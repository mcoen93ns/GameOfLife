Atomic behaviors:
- Determine if a cell is currently dead or alive
✔ 0 = dead
✔ 1 = alive

- Determine the amount of alive neighbours
Universes of 1 row:
✔[0,0,0] first cell -> 0 alive neighbours
✔[0,1,0] first cell -> 1 alive neighbour
✔[0,1,1] second cell -> 1 alive neighbour
✔[1,1,1] second cell -> 2 alive neighbours

Universes of 2 rows
[1,0,0] -> first cell, first row -> 0 alive neighbours
[0,0,0]

[1,1,0] -> first cell, first row -> 2 alive neighbours
[1,0,0]

[1,1,0] -> first cell,  first row -> 3 alive neighbours
[1,1,0]

[1,1,0] -> third cell, second row -> 2 alive neighbours
[1,1,0]


- Determine underpopulation -> when fewer than two live neighbours
- Determine reproduction -> when a dead cell has exactly 3 neighbours
- Determine overcrowding -> when a live cell has more than three live neighbours 

Customer question:
- Can we assume the input is valid
